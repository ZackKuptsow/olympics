# olympics

<h1>Olympics Dashboard built with Django/React</h1>
<p>When it starts to get warmer outside, my friends and I play a couple rounds of pickup games. This web app will track team stats, notify teams when and where they are playing, generate brackets and control/queue a Spotify account.</p>

<h4>Some improvements to be made in the future:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Replace class components with functional components</li>
    <li>Organize code (mostly React operations, router and components)</li>
    <li>Send sms to captain when court/field/table is ready/unoccupied</li>
    <li>More mobile friendly, possibly make a React Native app</li>
</ul>
